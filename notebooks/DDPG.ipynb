    "# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a python code for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Compared to methods using stochastic policy, where from given state $s$ the policy is defined as a probability distribution $\\pi(\\cdot|s)$ and the algorithm chooses one of the action based on that distribution, deterministic policy $\\mu(s)$ provides a specific value from the given state $s$, hence called **deterministic**.  The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971), and the code is modified from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-deterministic-policy-gradients-explained-2d94655a9b7b) and [this](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3/blob/master/OurDDPG.py) websites."
